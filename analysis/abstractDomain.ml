(* Constructors of this type are used to select parts of composed abstract
   domains. E.g., a Set domain will add an Element: element constructor for the
   element type of the set, thereby allowing folding, partitioning, and
   transforming the abstract domains by Elements. Similarly, a Map domain will
   add a constructor for the Key part of the map and delegate all other parts to
   the range. *)
